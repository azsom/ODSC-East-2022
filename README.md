## Prerequistes

Please run check_env.ipynb. It checks the versions of your python and some packages (like pandas, sklearn, xgboost). If the notebook returns all OK, you should be able to run the presentation without issues. If some FAILs are returned, you need to install/update those packages first.

You can recreate the python environment using the odsc_east_2022.yml conda environment file by running these two commands in the terminal:

`conda env create -n odsc_east_2022 -f odsc_east_2022.yml`

`conda activate odsc_east_2022`

You should be able to start jupyter-notebook now and run the check_env.ipynb.
